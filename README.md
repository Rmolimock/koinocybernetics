# Koinocybernetics

The study of self-governed systems, or 'joint steersmanship.'

---

Koinocybernetics is a theoretical framework focused on the study of self-governed systems. While cybernetics can be described as the study of self-regulating systems of all kinds - well beyond anthropocentric ones such as economies and political systems, Koinocybernetics extends that same multidisciplinary and abstract approach to the realm of collective self-regulation of a given number of autonomous nodes. By incorporating concepts from game theory, systems theory, and formal logic, Koinocybernetics will seek to formalize our understanding of the mechanisms through which such systems make decisions, collectively regulate their behavior, and protect a set of foundational axioms that ensure the integrity of the systems self-governance. The field aspires to understand the conditions under which self-governed systems can survive, evolve, and maintain their coherence in the face of challenges, both internal and external.
